# Test Coverage 

## MacOS

To automatically open Coverage after running Flutter test, you can use the following command in the terminal:

```bash
flutter test --coverage && open coverage/lcov-report/index.html
```

With the above command, after Flutter test finishes running, it will create coverage information and open the index.html file with the system's default browser.

To view the Coverage report, please install lcov. For MacOS, you can use Homebrew:

```bash
brew install lcov
```

After installing lcov, you can create the Coverage report by:

```bash
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html
```

Finally, open the Coverage report in the browser:

```bash
open coverage/html/index.html
```

## Windows

The above command works on Unix-based operating systems like MacOS or Linux. If you are using Windows, then you need to replace `open` with `start`:

```bash
flutter test --coverage && start coverage/lcov-report/index.html
```

To view the Coverage report, you need to install lcov. On Windows, you can install lcov via Cygwin or WSL.

After installing lcov, you can generate the Coverage report by:

```bash
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html
```

Finally, open the Coverage report in the browser:

```bash
start coverage/html/index.html
```

One thing to note is that the `start` command only works in PowerShell or Cmd, if you're using Git Bash, you need to replace `start` with `explorer`: 

```bash
flutter test --coverage && explorer coverage/lcov-report/index.html
```


### Other

Unfortunately, lcov is not easy to install on Windows. However, you can install it through some tools like Cygwin, MinGW or Windows Subsystem for Linux.

Here is the process of installing lcov through Cygwin:

1. Download and install Cygwin from its official website: https://cygwin.com/install.html. During the installation, make sure you've selected the gcc, make and perl packages to install (this is necessary for lcov).

2. Download lcov from its homepage on GitHub: https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov. You can download it as zip and then extract it to a folder on your machine.

3. Open Cygwin Terminal, navigate to the directory containing the extracted lcov files, then run `make install`. This will install lcov onto your system.

Please note that lcov will only be available from Cygwin Terminal - you won't be able to run it from Command Prompt.

Unfortunately, Lcov is not supported on Windows versions. You need to use a Unix-based environment by installing WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or Cygwin or MinGW.
